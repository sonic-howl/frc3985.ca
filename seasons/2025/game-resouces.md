## Bumpers

### [2025 Bumper Rule Changes (offical pdf from FRC)](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/game-and-season-info/2025-Bumper-Rule-Changes.pdf)
> The Bumper Task Force looked at the existing bumper materials and rules to see how
> they could be improved. The group came up with three overall goals on which to focus:
> 1. Make bumpers easier to build
> 2. Make bumpers easier to inspect
> 3. Improve options for teams to make more robust bumpers

### Changes:
- Gaps between segments increased from 0.5 in. → 1.5 in.
- Hard parts limit from 1 in. → 1.5in.
- Allow for heavier bumpers by only specifying a maximum overall robot weight
- More flexibility in backing materials and mounting solutions
- Remove specific measurement requirements on frame backing
- Reduce restrictions on backer thickness and holes
- Allow thicker padding extending up to 4.25 in. from the frame perimeter
- Allow taller bumpers
- Allow additional padding materials including
    - Backer rod
    - Foam floor tiles
    - Solid Polyethylene (PE) closed cell foam with density between 1.5 and 3
lb/cu ft.
    - Solid Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA) closed cell foam with density between
2 and 6 lb/cu ft.
    - Pool Noodles
- While hollow pool noodles will remain legal for 2025, testing
suggests that these new materials likely provide better protection.
- Increase bumper to bumper overlap between robots by requiring the bumpers to
fill the portion of the BUMPER ZONE between 2.5 in. and 5.5 in.
- Disallow weaker corner construction options including
    - Mitered corners
    - Wrap around corners
